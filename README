EE 396 Microrobotics 


This was code used for my EE396 project to control 2 xy mirrors to position the laser to reflect on a arena field and control the microrobot. The code also has vision control to follow the micorobot and make sure it stays on correct path.

gate_movement_control_v3.m - Final version of our code for task 1 (Move around an arbitrary path)

assembly_control.m - Final version of our code for task 2 (Manually move the robot to push triangles as close together as possible)
